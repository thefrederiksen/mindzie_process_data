# Hospital Process Mining & Real-Time Command Centre

## Slide Titles, Descriptions, and Timing (30 min total)

1. **What is Process Mining?** *(1 min)*  
   (Tongue-in-cheek intro for an expert audience; set the stage that this talk is about real-time, operational process mining, not just classic rework/variant analysis.)

2. **The Hospital ER Problem: Why Real-Time Matters** *(2 min)*  
   (Define the core challenge: optimizing and controlling ED flow in real time, not just analyzing after the fact.)

3. **Key Stages: What Can We Actually Control?** *(2 min)*  
   (Introduce the concept of key stages in the ED and how monitoring them enables operational intelligence and intervention.)

4. **Data Availability & Creation: The Role of Cursor** *(5 min)*  
   (Explain why we use synthetic/demo data, how Cursor helps generate realistic hospital event logs, and mention the open GitHub repo for reproducibility.)

5. **Demo Data in Action: From Dummy Data to Insights** *(2 min)*  
   (Show a quick example of the generated data and how it enables safe, shareable demos.)

6. **Command Centre Dashboard: Real-Time Hospital Control** *(3 min)*  
   (Introduce the command centre dashboard, its purpose, and how it visualizes key stage performance in near real time.)

7. **Anatomy of the Command Centre Dashboard** *(2 min)*  
   (Break down the main components: stage calculator, live metrics, alerts, and wall display.)

8. **Full-Screen Wall Dashboard for Command Centre** *(1 min)*  
   (Show how the dashboard can be used as a live wall display for operational teams.)

9. **Historical Data: Context for Todayâ€™s Performance** *(2 min)*  
   (Explain why historical benchmarks matter and how they inform real-time decisions.)

10. **Analyst Dashboard: Deep Dive into Historical Trends** *(2 min)*  
    (Show the analyst dashboard for root cause analysis, bottleneck detection, and improvement tracking.)

11. **Management Dashboard: Strategic Insights** *(2 min)*  
    (Show the management dashboard for high-level trends, compliance, and resource planning.)

12. **Floor Worker App: Real-Time & Motivational Views** *(2 min)*  
    (Show the app for ER staff: live stage calculator, shift/team performance, and motivational feedback.)

13. **App Overview: Command Centre, Management, Floor Workers** *(1 min)*  
    (Recap the three main apps and their audiences.)

14. **Screenshots: Command Centre App** *(1 min)*
15. **Screenshots: Management App** *(1 min)*
16. **Screenshots: Floor Worker App** *(1 min)*

17. **Open Source: Download the Data & Tools (GitHub Link)** *(1 min)*  
    (Point to the repo for data, code, and demo setup.)

18. **Best Practices for Real-Time Hospital Analytics** *(1 min)*
19. **Lessons Learned & Implementation Tips** *(1 min)*
20. **Q&A** *(2 min)*
21. **Thank You & Contact Information** *(<1 min)*
